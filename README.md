# Kotlin With C
This project is a Prove Of Concept (POV):
The concept is that Kotlin/Java can integrate C/C++ Code using the Java Native Interface (JNI)

## Requirements
- installed Android NDK - size:1.1GB

## Application
- Using popular C/C++ Libraries
- Use as Prebuilt libraries to fast build/compile time
- Big apps/games needs intensive CPU resource

## Example 
As for this example, the idea is to return a C/C++ String to the MainActivity.kt to display it. 
cpp file contains the CMake, and C/C++ code
